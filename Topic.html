          <h1>Applications of H2</h2>
          <h2>Petrochemical industry</h2>

          <p>Large quantities of H</p>
          <p>2 are used in the "upgrading" of fossil fuels. Key consumers of H2 include
            hydrodealkylation, hydrodesulfurization, and hydrocracking. Many of these
            reactions can be classified as hydrogenolysis, i.e., the cleavage of bonds
            to carbon. Illustrative is the separation of sulfur from liquid fossil fuels:</p>

              <p>R-S-R + 2 H2 → H2S + 2 RH</p>

          <H2>Hydrogenation</h2>

          <p>Hydrogenation, the addition of H2 to various substrates is conducted on a large scale.
            The hydrogenation of N2 to produce
            ammonia by the Haber-Bosch Process consumes a few percent of the energy budget in the
            entire industry. The resulting ammonia is used to supply the majority of the protein
            consumed by humans. Hydrogenation is used to convert unsaturated fats and oils to
            saturated fats and oils. The major application is the production of margarine. Methanol is
            produced by hydrogenation of carbon dioxide. It is similarly the source of hydrogen in the
            manufacture of hydrochloric acid. H2 is also used as a reducing agent for the conversion
            of some ores to the metals.</p>

          <h2>Coolant</h2>

          <p>Hydrogen is commonly used in power stations as a coolant in generators due to a number of
          favorable properties that are a direct result of its light diatomic molecules. These include
          low density, low viscosity, and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all
          gases.</p>

          <h2>Energy carrier</h2>

          <p>Hydrogen is not an energy resource as a combustion fuel because there is no naturally
          occurring source of hydrogen in useful quantities. The Sun's energy comes from nuclear
          fusion of hydrogen, but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth. Elemental
          hydrogen from solar, biological, or electrical sources requires more energy to make than is
          obtained by burning it, so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier, like a
          battery. Hydrogen may be obtained from fossil sources (such as methane), but these sources
          are unsustainable.<p>
          <img src="images/300px-Fuel_cell_NL.svg.png" alt="schema fuelcel" />
          <p>The energy density per unit volume of both liquid hydrogen and compressed hydrogen gas at any
          practicable pressure is significantly less than that of traditional fuel sources, although the
          energy density per unit fuel mass is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been
          widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future carrier of energy on an
          economy-wide scale.For example, CO2 sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage
          could be conducted at the point of H2 production from fossil fuels. Hydrogen used in
          transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some NOx emissions, but without carbon
          emissions. However, the infrastructure costs associated with full conversion to a hydrogen
          economy would be substantial. Fuel cells can convert hydrogen and oxygen directly to
          electricity more efficiently than internal combustion engines.<p>

          <h2>Semiconductor industry</h2>

          <p>Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken ("dangling") bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous
          carbon that helps stabilizing material properties. It is also a potential electron donor
          in various oxide materials, including ZnO, SnO2, CdO, MgO, ZrO2, HfO2, La2O3, Y2O3, TiO2,
          SrTiO3, LaAlO3, SiO2, Al2O3, ZrSiO4, HfSiO4, and SrZrO3.</p>

          <h2>Rocket propellant</h2>

          <p>Liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen together serve as cryogenic fuel in liquid-propellant rockets,
          as in the Space Shuttle main engines.</p>
